Data cleansing
==============

Often, the data you have will have errors, and you'll need to clean it up.
Missing data, inconsistent labels, duplicates and misspellings are common
examples of errors. The [Wikipedia article on data
cleansing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) talks more about this.

The typical cycle of data cleansing is:

1. Find errors
2. Correct the errors
3. Repeat 1 & 2 as often required
4. Automate the correction process for new data feeds
