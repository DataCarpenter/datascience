# SQLite
## Introduction
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is a self contained, serverless, zero configuration database. The whole database is contained in a single file which can be manipulated like any other file. SQLite is useful not only to store data but also rules related to data (offers structured data) as its a full RDBMS. SQLite file format and database engine is in public domain. Many popular softwares like Firefox and Chrome use sqlite as internal storage engine. 

There are free and open source tools available on all platforms for browsing/querying SQLite database. Most popular ones are [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/) for Firfox, [Sqlite](http://aaa.andsen.dk/aSQLiteManager.html) for Android, [SQliteMan](http://sqliteman.com/) for Windows etc

SQLite is useful to both programmers and non programmers alike. A simple course on [SQL aka Structured Query Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) will help anybody to get most of it.

There are APIs available in all programing languages to interact with SQLite. 

High level APIs like [DumpTruck](http://www.dumptruck.io/) makes interacting with the database as easy as interacting with an array or dict.
