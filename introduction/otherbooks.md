# Other handbooks

Here is a compilation of handbooks similar to this one.

## [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/)

This book is intended to be a useful resource for anyone who thinks that they might be interested in becoming a data journalist, or dabbling in data journalism.

Lamentably the act of reading this book will not supply you with a comprehensive repertoire of all if the knowledge and skills you need to become a data journalist. This would require a vast library manned by hundreds of experts able to help answer questions on hundreds of topics. Luckily this library exists and it is called the internet. Instead, we hope this book will give you a sense of how to get started and where to look if you want to go further. Examples and tutorials serve to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

## [Data Wrangling Handbook](http://handbook.schoolofdata.org/)

The Data Wrangling Handbook is a companion text to the [School of
Data](http://schoolofdata.org/). Its function is something like a traditional
textbook - it will provide the detail and background theory to support the
School of Data courses and challenges.

## [The Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/)

This handbook introduces you to the **legal, social and technical aspects** of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially useful for those working with government data. It discusses the why, what and how of open data â€“ why to go open, what open is, and the how to do open.
