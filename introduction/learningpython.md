# Learning Python

## Free online books

- [Google's Python Class](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html).

  This is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience
  who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials, lecture
  videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. These
  materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just
  a little programming experience. The first exercises work on basic Python
  concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which
  are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections.
  The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming
  experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if
  statement" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to
  use this material.

- [The Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)

  This tutorial is part of Python's documentation set and is updated with each
  new release.

- [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

  LPTHW emphasizes precision, attention to detail, and persistence by
  requiring you to type each exercise (no copy-paste!) and make it run, as
  well as to read up on outside topics and to return to exercises and ideas
  that you don't understand, and understand them.

  At the end of LPTHW, you'll know the basics of coding, and be ready to move
  on to more challenging books. Or at least you'll have tried something new.

- [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/).

  Dive Into Python is a free Python book for experienced programmers. It was
  originally hosted at DiveIntoPython.org, but the author has pulled down all
  copies. It is being mirrored here.

- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/index.html).

  This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python
  developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and
  usage of Python on a daily basis.

- [A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.org/notes/Python).

  A Byte of Python' is a free book on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this is the book for you.

- [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/?r=iTunes)

  This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience.
  It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation
  can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of
  their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small
  programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the
  Python programming language.

- [Udacity's Introduction to Computer Science](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012)

  In this course you will learn key concepts in computer science and learn how
  to write your own computer programs in the context of building a web
  crawler.

- [Coursera's Learn to Program](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1)

  This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program.
  It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work
  and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, youâ€™ll
  start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to
  solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common
  fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts
  using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will
  be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create
  interactive text-based games.

- [Codecademy's Python](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

  Codecademy is an online interactive platform that offers free coding classes
  in programming languages like Python and Javascript, as well as markup
  languages including HTML, and CSS.

  To motivate users to participate, the site offers encouraging feedback,
  badges for completing exercises, as well as a function that keeps track of a
  user's total score and displays it to others.

## Tools

- [DreamPie!](http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/)
  DreamPie is a Python shell which is designed to be reliable and fun.DreamPie features a new concept for an interactive shell: the window is divided into the history box, which lets you view previous commands and their output, and the code box, where you write your code. This allows you to edit any amount of code, just like in your favorite editor, and execute it when it's ready. You can also copy code from anywhere, edit it and run it instantly.
